# python-safe-unlock-attempts
üîê A Python script that mimics a digital safe with secure 4-digit code verification and limited access attempts.

This Python script simulates a digital safe lock system that requires a 4-digit unlock code (8520). The user is given 5 chances to enter the correct code.

    If the correct code is entered, it prints "safe opened".

    If the code is incorrect, it prints "wrong code" and informs the user how many attempts are left.

    After 5 failed attempts, the safe becomes permanently locked and displays "safe permanently locked".

This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the use of:

    for loops

    input() function

    Conditional (if-else) logic

    Basic security flow control
